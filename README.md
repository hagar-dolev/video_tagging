- `people` - List of people present
- `key_moments` - Timestamped key moments
- `location` - Location classification
- `actions` - Actions occurring in the video
- `movement` - Camera movement type
- `movement_description` - Description for custom camera movements
- `content_movement` - Movement of subjects/content in the video
- `content_movement_description` - Description for custom content movements
- `shot_type` - Shot composition type
- `general_tags` - Additional free-form tags

## UI Features

- **Resizable Panels** - Adjust video and tagging panel sizes
- **Scrollable Interface** - All tagging options accessible via scrolling
- **Visual Feedback** - Styled buttons and organized sections
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab through fields for efficient tagging

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: PyQt6 for the GUI
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV for thumbnail generation
- **Media Playback**: Qt Multimedia for video playback
- **Data Export**: Pandas for CSV generation
- **File Formats**: Supports multiple video formats

## Tips for Efficient Tagging

1. **Use the timestamp button** while watching videos to mark key moments
2. **Leverage checkboxes** for common actions to speed up tagging
3. **Be consistent** with location and shot type classifications
4. **Use the general tags** for any specific details not covered by structured fields
5. **Save frequently** to avoid losing work
