     - **People**: Enter names separated by commas
     - **Key Moments**: Use "Add Current Time" button while playing, then describe the moment
     - **General Caption**: Describe the overall video content without time references
     - **Location**: Select from dropdown or type custom location
     - **Actions**: Check common actions or type custom ones
     - **Movement**: Check multiple camera movements that occur in the shot (with "Other" option for custom descriptions)

     - **Handheld Camera**: Indicate if the camera is handheld
     - **Depth of Field**: Describe the depth of field characteristics
     - **Color Scale**: Select color characteristics (with "Other" option for custom descriptions)
     - **General Tags**: Add any additional tags

3. **Save and Export**
   - Tags are auto-saved when navigating between videos
   - Click "Save Tags" to manually save current video's tags (optional)
   - Click "Export to CSV" to export all tags to a structured CSV file

## CSV Export Format

The exported CSV contains the following columns:

- `file_path` - Path to the video file
- `people` - List of people present
- `key_moments` - Timestamped key moments
- `caption` - General description of video content
- `location` - Location classification
- `actions` - Actions occurring in the video
- `movement` - Camera movement type
- `movement_description` - Description for custom camera movements
- `content_movement` - Movement of subjects/content in the video
- `shot_type` - Shot composition type
- `handheld` - Whether camera is handheld
